## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I knew that it would take a significant amount of experimentation to match the design images as closely as possible without something like a figma or AdobeXD file, and the project did indeed take much longer than expected. I had to spend some extra time looking up srcset syntax and messing around with different ways of presenting the image, but besides that the process of laying out the html, setting some basic styles, then tinkering until I got a product that seemed presentable was rather standard.
