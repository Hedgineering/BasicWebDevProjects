    <!-- IMPORTANT CONCEPT : viewPort vs viewBox -->
    <!-- viewport is basically the size of the 
            window you're looking at the svg through
            -This is defined by the width and height -->
    <!-- viewBox is the box represented by your viewport
            but projected onto the plane the svg lives in
        
            -for example, viewBox="0 0 250 250" says
                your viewBox will be defined such that your 
                viewport's top left vertex starts at the 0,0
                of the svg existence plane, and your viewport
                spans 250 in the x and 250 in the y of the svg plane
            
                viewBox="0 0 500 500" says your viewport
                starts at 0,0 of the svg plane, and spans 500 wide
                and 500 tall. This effectively zooms out by 50%
                since now you are looking at twice as much area
                of the svg plane as you were looking at when the
                view box was spanning 250 by 250.

                similarly, viewBox="0 0 125 125" would effectively
                zoom in by 50%.

                in short, viewBox defines how much of the svg plane
                is shown inside your viewPort.

                by default it is the same size as your viewPort 
                (width, height) of the svg, but when that changes,
                the zoom along the x and y essentially changes
