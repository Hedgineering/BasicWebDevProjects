Message:
    I made this little project in about 1 hour,
    and it was made as a practice project to learn
    some asynchronous HTTP request methods with the 
    Javascript XMLHttpRequest() object. It's an older
    method of programming with AJAX (Async JS and XML)
    but still functional to be sure. 

    It simply makes a GET request to the github users api
    asynchronously and displays the data as soon as it is
    retrieved.
